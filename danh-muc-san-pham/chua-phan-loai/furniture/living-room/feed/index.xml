										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This conference chair is an ideal pick, whether you’re completing your home office or office conference room. It’s built with a metal frame and features a curved back that provides lumbar support. Open armrests offer additional support as you tackle your to-dos. The chair is upholstered in faux leather and is filled with foam for just the right amount of cushion. Subtle channel tufting on the back and seat create a tailored aesthetic. The star-shaped base has five bent legs with hooded casters that allow you to roll throughout your space. Plus, you can change the back angle, the height of the seat, and swivel a full 360.</p>
